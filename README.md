# Welcome

Welcome to this half-day workshop on the custom vision service. In this workshop, we will focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency with the custom vision service.

# Goals

At the end of this workshop, you should be able to effectively leverage the custom vision service to create image classification services that can then be leveraged by an application

# Pre-requisites

This workshop is meant for an AI Developer on Azure. Since this is only a short workshop, there are certain things you need before you arrive.

Firstly, you should have some previous exposure to Visual Studio. We will be using it for everything we are building in the workshop, so you should be familiar with [how to use it](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/visual-studio-ide) to create applications. Additionally, this is not a class where we teach you how to code or develop applications. We assume you have some familiarity with C# (intermediate level - you can learn [here](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-us/training-courses/c-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-16169?l=Lvld4EQIC_2706218949)), but you do not know how to implement solutions with Cognitive Services.

Thirdly, you should have experience with the portal and be able to create resources (and spend money) on Azure. We will not be providing Azure passes for this workshop.

Finally, before arriving at the workshop, we expect you to have configured the following for Custom Vision:

* Training API Key: The training API key allows you to create, manage and train Custom Vision project programmatically. You can obtain a key by creating a new project at [https://customvision.ai](https://customvision.ai) and then clicking on the ``setting'' gear in the top right.
